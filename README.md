# NN Builder

## Description

This web application enables users to create their own custom neural network, train it, and analyze the results. Users can easily design their neural network architecture, choose the appropriate activation functions, optimization algorithms etc. and train their model using their own dataset. Once the training is complete, users can analyze the performance metrics and visualize the output to gain insights into their data. With this tool, users can create custom neural networks tailored to their specific needs without any programming skills and AI frameworks knowledge.
